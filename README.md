Reference: python deep learning projects, M. Lamons, R. Kumar, A. Nagaraja

* Step 1: load pre-trained deep learning model such as Yolov3, resnet, etc.

* Step 2: feed new images to the model for detection. 
  *  The result return the image with bounding box coordinates of the detected object, the label of the detected object and the confidence score for the detected object.
